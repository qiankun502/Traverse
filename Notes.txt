CUR_SNS1 use BDMA and only 12bits adc.
would be better if use ADC1 channel IN14 (PA2).

Protocol of UART:
#A;000; autocycle off
#A;xxx; autocycle on and autocycle wait time = xxx second

#B;x,y,z,v; Download request from Pi. Upload the Open door V_start_Open, V_Open, V_end_open, V_start_close, V_close, V_end_close......

formate example "#B;1,0,1,100;"  means download and V_start_Open[0][1] to 100.
formate example "#B;2,0,1,100;"  means download and V_Open[0][1] to 100.
The second integer is the groupname number: '1':V_start_Open; '2':V_Open; '3':V_end_Open;'4':V_start_Close;  '5':V_Close;'6':V_end_close


#b;1; Upload request from Pi. Upload the Open door V_start_Open, V_Open, V_end_open and the Close door V_start_close, V_close, V_end_close... for angle zone 1
#b;2; Upload request from Pi.  Upload the Open door V_start_Open, V_Open, V_end_open and the Close door V_start_close, V_close, V_end_close... for angle zone 2
formate as "#b;100,100,90,.......,100;
